        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        Your program must destroy the enemy ships by shooting the closest enemy on each turn.
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        On each start of turn (within the game loop), you obtain information on the two closest enemies:
        enemy1 and dist1: the name and the distance to enemy 1.
        enemy2 and dist2: the name and the distance to enemy 2.
        Before your turn is over (end of the loop), output the value of either enemy1 or enemy2 to shoot the closest enemy.
